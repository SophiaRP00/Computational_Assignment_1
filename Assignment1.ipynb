    "\n",
    "What are pros and cons of the custom-made data used in Centola's experiment (the first study presented in the lecture) and the ready-made data used in Nicolaides's study (the second study presented in the lecture)? You can support your arguments based on the content of the lecture and the information you read in Chapter 2.3 of the book (answer in max 150 words).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ANSWER: <br>\n",
    "The pros of custom-made data as seen in Centola's experiments is that the experiment was designed in a controlled environment, reducing confounding variables and making it easuer to establish relationsships between people in Centola's experiment. However, there are quite a lot of cons when using custom-made data such as limited generalisability and smaller sample sizes. The largest issue is being nonreactive which can explain how certain people might perform better, since they are being watched. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to Nicolaide's study, we see that it provides a better insight into socital interactions as it is performed on \"real-life data. However, we see that Ready-made data is generally sensitive as well as dirty and lacks reproduceability. This is also the case when it comes to Nicolaide's study where the data might reflect real-life networks compared to custom-made but it comes at the cost of the privacy of the participants. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### ANSWER <br>\n",
    "Using custom-made data is good when it comes to reproducability, but it might lead to wrong conclusions about societal networks. Ready-made data is more likely to lead to a more realistic interpretation about real-life situation, but as it is hard to reproduce, it might in that sense be difficult to argue for generability. Additionally, there might be unobserved confounders or homophily like mentioned in the video where people are friends with similar people or holidays or weather affects our actions. These will generally affect our data analysis and might lead to false conclusions.\n",

    "#### Question:\n",
    "Describe the strategies you implemented to make your code more efficient. How did your approach affect your code's execution time?\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "We used several strategies for speed. We used filters in our both our own author list, and in our api requests to make sure that every result returned was actually relevant. Additionally we grouped 10 authors per request as most authors only have a few papers, so getting more results back from each request allowed for higher speeds. Finanally we used multithreading, to enable multiple simultaneous calls. This made the code run quite fast, in fact, it includes a sleep(0.6) because it kept running too fast for the api.\n",
    "#### Question:\n",
    "Reflect on the rationale behind setting specific thresholds for the total number of works by an author, the citation count, the number of authors per work, and the relevance of works to specific fields. How do these filtering criteria contribute to the relevance of the dataset you compiled? Do you believe any aspects of Computational Social Science research might be underrepresented or overrepresented as a result of these choices? \n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "Filtering criteria help guide the collection of data. That said, in a relatively new field such as Computational Social Science, limiting ourselves to only papers with \\>10 citations, can potentially, limit our understanding of more recent changes. As this is data from a conference in 2024, this risks eliminating new researchers, or papers published recently. Additionally the topic filter has problems, due to how OpenAlex structures its topics. This potentially results in actual computational social science getting drowned out by papers in other genres, that happed to be tagged with topics like \"mathematics\""

    "Is the network fully connected (i.e., is there a direct or indirect path between every pair of nodes within the network), or is it disconnected?\n",
    "If the network is disconnected, how many connected components does it have? A connected component is defined as a subset of nodes within the network where a path exists between any pair of nodes in that subset.\n",
    "How many isolated nodes are there in your network? An isolated node is defined as a node with no connections to any other node in the network.\n",
    "Discuss the results above on network density, and connectivity. Are your findings in line with what you expected? Why? (answer in max 150 words)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ANSWER <br>\n",
    "We see above that we have captured rougly 18 thousand authors with 72 thousand collaborations between them <br>\n",
    "The network is sparse with a density of  around 0.000458. This makes sense as the maximum number of links is n*(n-1)/2 or 157149856 in this case, and we have nowhere near that many collaborations. <br>\n",
    "We also see that the graph has 107 connected components, meaning the network is disconnected. <br>\n",
    "Finally we know there are no isolated authors, as we constructed the graph (and hence all the nodes) entirely from edges <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "These findings make sense, as most authors will not collaborate with anywhere near 18 thousand other authors, so the network density will be low. The graph not being connected also makes sense, as different fields and locations might prevent authors from co-authoring with others who are either far-away or working on a different topic"
